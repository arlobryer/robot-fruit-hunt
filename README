Welcome!

Modify mybot.js to start writing your bot. Opening game.html will allow you to generate random boards, and either watch your bot play or step through one move at a time. Refer to http://www.scribd.com/jobs/botrace_api for available methods. gl/hf!

Scribd.

ps: you should be able to ignore everything in assets/, but if you want to disable the opponent bot from playing in game.html, go to assets/simplebot.js and find:
    makeMove: function() {
       // to disable to opponent, uncomment the next line
       // return PASS;

Uncomment the "return PASS;" and your bot will be free to roam the board alone.

My aim was to make a very basic bot with a simple algorithm and to use this as an exercise to play with JS. This is implemented in the mybot.js file.
This bot may be tested locally by opening game.html.
You can see this bot's live performance at http://www.scribd.com/jobs/botrace_rankings - the bot's names are (various versions for different parameter tweaking) 'Noobot vx.y.z'. The best is currently ranked 321/766.

A description and implementation of a similar bot (which predates mine!) can be found at:
